# How to make a branch in vs code

ctrl+shift+P. Git: Clone repository

either paste the url to the repository or select "Clone from Github" and log in where i think you'll be able to access it automatically afterwards. pick a directory to put the clone in on your machine.

ctrl+shift+P. Create branch from... and select main (or whatever you want to branch from)

to commit, go to the version control section on the sidebar. write a message in the message box, ctrl+enter. if it says something about staging changes just press yes lol. alternatively, stage the changes you want and discard the ones you don't by clicking the plus or weird backwards arrow symbols. ask in discord if stuck cuz its hard to explain lol

'git pull' in the git bash terminal will merge any changes from main to your branch

# How to launch

In VS Code:

ctrl+shift+P to open command palette. Go to >Python: Create environment... and then select venv. Select python 3.13 (or whatever it says idk).

in **cmd** terminal, type "pip install -r requirements.txt"

then "cd fish" (no quotes)

then "flask run" (no quotes)
